# Product Overview

MediFind is a medicine reservation and pharmacy management platform that connects patients with local pharmacies. The application serves three user roles:

- **Patients**: Search for medicines, check availability across pharmacies, and reserve medications
- **Pharmacies**: Manage inventory, handle reservation requests, and track business metrics
- **Admins**: Oversee pharmacy approvals, manage medicine database, and view system analytics

The platform enables real-time medicine availability checking, reservation workflows with status tracking (pending, accepted, rejected), and multi-role dashboards with role-specific functionality.
